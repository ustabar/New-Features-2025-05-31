The GitHub Copilot Coding Agent is in public preview, 
not yet in General Availability (GA), as of the latest updates from May 2025. 
It is available to Copilot Pro+ and Copilot Enterprise subscribers and requires 
enabling in repository or organization settings. The agent can autonomously 
handle tasks like coding, testing, and creating pull requests from GitHub Issues, 
consuming premium requests and GitHub Actions minutes.
